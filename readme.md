# geneMaze

A true masterpiece!

Project Description:
    - Generates a random maze each time the "play again" button is pressed 
    - An algorithm takes care of the previously mentioned
    - 2d arrays keep track of what walls to delete in order to make a valid path
    - The same happens for the grid layout

Built using:
    - ES6
    - MatterJS

Extra notes:
    - Had a bit of conflict with VSCode and Github, it did a master branch even though I updated Git >_< goodbye main branch and new git standards
